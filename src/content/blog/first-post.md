My mom is visiting me and she is actually the reason me and Reba got in touch.
My mom loves to look up people who she knew a long time ago and see what they
are doing now. So she let me know that Reba's band, Code Orange was nominated 
for a Grammy. Both me and my mom listen to a lot of music but we don't really
    listen to metal so we didn't have a clue.

I asked my mom what she remembered about Reba and she didn't remember much. She
said that some kids talk to adults and she used to have conversations with those
kids. But some kids only talk to other kids and Reba was one of them. So she had
very little information about Reba.

Mostly what my mom remembered is her impression that Reba had a really nice
family. Her dad ran the after school chess club in the Pittsburgh Public Schools
(according to my mom). I actually remember going to chess club in fourth grade
and learning to play chess. I haven't played much chess since then but I still
know the rules, and Reba's dad must have been the one to to teach me. My mom
thinks Reba's mom was a psychologist or psychiatrist. My mom thought she had a
younger sister, but she actually has an older sister, and didn't remember her
brother at all. So my mother's memories aren't the most reliable.
